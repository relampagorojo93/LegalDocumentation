        <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <div style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">
            By purchasing any of the offered products by my person, such as Patreon or Spigot as example, you agree with the following terms and conditions:
            <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                <li>
                    The decompilation or resell of the products without my authorization is forbidden. I know how things work, and it's almost impossible to deal with this kind of things, so I leave this kind of conditions to rethink it before doing anything with the products that may go against my person
                </li>
                <li>
                    Things like plugins are made with the intention to provide, at the end of its road, a final version that will try to fit with all the requirements a common person would require according to its purpose. This means that it can reach a point where it'll not get any more updates beside fixes if there's nothing really important to implement on the plugin and it already has a lot of content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This means that I'm actually not linked on a professional way with any of my products. The idea of their development or creation is to offer people something they could need, as you pay to get products you require for your projects, but prices has their costs. I try to create a good relation between the price and my healthcare, meaning that the low prices also can mean that there could be a point where I would require to stop developing, temporary or permanently.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In case that any product reaches the end, reaching some goals and being some time without updates as it's already polished, or it gets abandoned or the project has been previously announced that its development will be shut down, this products will become available as (still deciding) a free source code open to the public, or a private code which people that had access to the plugin will be able to get the source code. The idea is that people can keep maintaining it or implementing new features in case I decide to stop working on them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As previously mentioned in the other conditions, there can be a chance that, after some time and already reaching some goals on the projects, I'll become more inactive, on some specific projects or on every project if my health requires it. This means that you're aware that you paid the product you bought with this knowledge, and if it was worth it or not is something you only can decide. In case you don't agree with any of this policies, I'll suggest you to not buy any of the products.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As previously mentioned in other conditions, the idea of the development and creation of my products is to provide some people something they could miss or require for some kind of projects. This means it's possible some of the suggestions you may request will not get implemented. Reaching some products' goals will allow this product to get a new modification that will provide more major features, that can be some of your suggestions, but that doesn't mean some of them could be rejected. The idea is that this products have one or multiple purposes for which they were created, and it's not part of our plan to create a whole new thing different than the original, except if it's intended to become a new product.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Price may vary depending on the situation, some examples, due economic situations or because part of the products development. One thing that's clear, is that developments can reach a point where they increase the amount of provided features, the implemented code, the required work to make something, etc. If any product reaches a point where its value is increased due its features, it may get a new price that could be higher or lower than the original at any time. This also goes for things like Patreon, it can also vary the prices of the tiers in case some of them starts offering more products than before.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some products may come with some issues, as they require lot of time to be developed, and some of them are launched as alpha versions, which are pre-launched versions used to find this kind of issues, or some bugs may be found while using them that haven't been registered yet. Is my work to fix them, but that doesn't mean that I'll take part of my scheduled time to fix this issues, more if I'm facing some other important things, or it takes me on an urgent situation. I try to give my best to fix them as fast as possible, so I'll be asking for patience while fixing this issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One of the most important things, is that I'm aware that it's my job, I decided to develop this kind of products or projects, but I'm also human. I have other commitments besides my products, this means I can sometimes be really busy, sometimes I can be on a situation where it's counterproductive to start developing, and this may affect on some way on the deliver time of some updates. I appreciate being aware about this kind of details, as I'm aiming for a balance that can benefit both of us even with this inconveniences.
